# Text Variant Preference in SwiftUI

#wwdc2024 #swiftui

> üí° TL;DR: Use the `.textVariant(.sizeDependent)` view modifier to automatically format and fit text inside `Text` view‚Äôs size.

I stumbled upon this cute new SwiftUI view modifier called `.textVariant(...)` while looking for a way to scale font size to fit inside any `Text` view (I‚Äôm not sure which WWDC 2024 session this new API was discussed in). This new `Text` view modifier makes rendering text that can be formatted in various variants easier (think short or long dates, for example), without needing to use conditional views or `ViewThatFits`.

___

### Use Case

Imagine a `Text` view that displays the date on which some record was updated.  We can achieve this in a few ways in SwiftUI:

```swift
Text(Date.distantPast, style: .date)
Text(Date.distantPast, format: .dateTime)
/// e.g. DateFormatter where dateStyle = .full
Text(Date.distantPast, formatter: Self.dateFormatter)
```

This code resolves to the following views:

However, this could be an issue if the `Text` view‚Äôs width is forced to shrink to accommodate other content, and is constrained to a line limit of 1.

Previously, we would have to have to either use `ViewThatFits` or use conditional views to ensure that our date text never displays as truncated text.

```swift
ViewThatFits {
	Text(Date.distantPast, formatter: Self.fullDateFormatter)
	Text(Date.distantPast, formatter: Self.longDateFormatter)
	Text(Date.distantPast, formatter: Self.mediumDateFormatter)
	Text(Date.distantPast, formatter: Self.shortDateFormatter)
}
.lineLimit(1)
```

Now, new in iOS 18 (and all other platforms), we can achieve this with a simple call to `.textVariant(.sizeDependent)`.

```swift
Text(Date.distantPast, format: .dateTime)
	.textVariant(.sizeDependent)
	.lineLimit(1)
```

In fact, the text variant view modifier appears to generate even shorter text variants than what `DateFormatter` offers, as seen in this screenshot here (the last two variants aren‚Äôt available via `DateFormatter` out of the box).

While this means we can write less code to avoid truncating formatted text, it‚Äôs worth noting that this new text variant modifier differs from `ViewThatFits` ‚Äùboth in usage and behavior‚Äù ([see discussion here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textvariantpreference/sizedependent#Difference-to-doccomappleSwiftUIdocumentationSwiftUIViewThatFits) in Apple‚Äôs documentation). 

What‚Äôs great is this new API works on all Apple devices, including visionOS and macOS, and works with other formatted text, including the new `.stopwatch(...)` format style in iOS 18 ([see here)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/systemformatstyle/stopwatch).
